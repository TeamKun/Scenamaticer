Reports redundant action arguments usage.
<br>
The utilization of redundant arguments is considered a breach of the Action Usage Policy. Each action is designed to be
used within specific parameters, including its designated type and the requisite conditions for its implementation.
<br>
The redundant action arguments usage won't be considered a violation of the policy and subsequent
repercussions; however, it is recommended to provide only the necessary arguments for the action's usage.
