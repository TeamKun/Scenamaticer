Reports unsupported action usage.
<br>
The utilization of unsupported actions is considered a breach of the Action Usage Policy. Each action is designed to be
used within specific parameters, including its designated type and the requisite conditions for its implementation.
Actions are accompanied by a set of parameters denoting where and when they can be appropriately applied.
<br>
To ensure compliance, it is imperative to provide the requisite argument necessary for the action's usage. Failure to do
so may result in a violation of the policy and subsequent repercussions.
